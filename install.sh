# which makes a later package install fail on file conflicts and lets a package
# upgrade silently replace a local build. Two of the four artifacts -- the PAM
# module and the systemd user units -- must live under /usr because libpam and
# systemd only search there, so /usr/local is not available as a middle ground.
