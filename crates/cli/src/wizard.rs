//! The interactive menu: the primary way to operate this app without
//! memorizing subcommands (tracks #1, "Unified interactive menu as the
//! primary CLI control surface").
//!
//! Every action here is a thin front-end over the same internals the
//! equivalent subcommand uses — `devices`, `enrollment`, `setup`, `doctor`,
//! `client` — so nothing here has logic the non-interactive CLI lacks.
//! Bare `omarchy-presence-unlock` in a terminal, or `init` explicitly, opens
//! this menu; every other subcommand is unaffected, so scripts and agents
//! never hit a prompt.
//!
//! The menu runs full-screen: it takes over the terminal's alternate screen
//! buffer for the duration and hands the shell back exactly as it found it.
//! Screens are painted by [`crate::ui`], never printed, so a long operation
//! can revise its own checklist in place.
//!
//! Enrollment is a short guided flow that closes itself. `Enter` advances,
//! `Esc` backs out of the current screen, and `Ctrl+C` leaves the wizard —
//! nothing here asks for `Ctrl+C` as the ordinary way to dismiss a finished
//! screen. Guided pairing (a Watch or phone) captures an identity key, while
//! the "Other Bluetooth device" route only locates a device and remembers its
//! address.
